<section class=post-content><h2 id=good-practices-from-the-twelve-factor-app>Good practices from the Twelve-Factor app</h2>
<p>When developing modern web application or services, the <a href=https://12factor.net/port-binding>Twelve-factor app</a> taught us that our services</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is completely self-contained and does not rely on runtime injection of a webserver into the execution environment to create a web-facing service. The web app exports HTTP as a service by binding to a port, and listening to requests coming in on that port.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means is that our apps written with modern frameworks (like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-3.1">ASP.NET Core</a>) should provide their own web-servers, exposing a HTTP port, and not require anything in front for hosting, like <code>IIS</code> or Apache <code>HTTPD</code>. For local development, you should be able to run the app without any third-party component requirements for hosting, and the app should be reachable on <code>http://localhost:5000/</code> as an example.</p>
<p>Now hosting the app <em>directly</em> in this way in a production setting is something you <em>don&rsquo;t want</em> to do for obvious reasons, since the infrastructure-layer of the app would grow thick, and the developer must code in all sort of hardening, routing etc, not to mention the security concerns - that self-hosted HTTP server would be exposed all on it&rsquo;s own as an attack-vector. When running in production, a component suitable for the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy>reverse-proxy</a> role should be responsible for binding a public-facing hostname to the app(s), as well as do HTTPS termination - the app itself should focus on what it does best, the business logic (this is why it exists in the first place), while a component like <a href=https://www.nginx.com/>nginx</a> or <a href=http://www.haproxy.org/>HAProxy</a> should handle hostname binding, HTTPS and load-balance incoming requests.</p>
<p>Modern platforms like <a href=https://kubernetes.io/>Kubernetes</a> or <a href=https://www.openshift.com/>OpenShift</a> offers <em>routes</em> that gives the app an external-reachable hostname, and load-balances the application when running on different nodes, as well as provide HTTPS termination up-front. For small solutions not needing a container orchestrator, plain old nginx in front works great.</p>
<p>All modern application <em>should</em> be hosted with SSL and HTTPS. Thanks to projects like <a href=https://letsencrypt.org/>Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a>, trusted SSL certificates can be obtained for free, and the world is now, slowly but surely, moving to HTTPS as default. This does not mean that our application&rsquo;s first meeting with HTTPS should be in a staging or production environment, it should also ble possible to develop and test locally with HTTPS as default. Thanks to modern tools, running a local reverse-proxy with a valid HTTPS certificate is quite straight forward.</p>
<h2 id=local-reverse-proxy-with-ssl-termination>Local reverse-proxy with SSL termination</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have a single application, <code>MyService</code>, that is written with ASP NET, running with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel?view=aspnetcore-3.1">Kestrel</a>. The app has no code for HTTPS-redirects, and knows nothing about any SSL certificate or setup, it only talks HTTP on port 80. The application is destined for a life in a container orchestrator of some kind, so it has a <code>Dockerfile</code>. To be able to run the <code>MyService</code> application via HTTPS in an environment <em>similar but not equal to</em>, let&rsquo;s say Kubernets, we need to run it behind a reverse-proxy when testing locally. We also need some sort of SSL certificate. Earlier in the post I mentioned Let&rsquo;s Encrypt that offers free certificates, but to be able to leverage it, a public-facing hostname is needed. For local development, a self-signed certificate is plenty. Now the road down self-signed certificates can be quite dirty and lead to many half-working solutions and &ldquo;not-trusted&rdquo; warnings in the browser. One easy solution is using a great tool called <a href=https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert>mkcert</a>. <code>mkcert</code> is a simple CLI that registers a trusted CA on your machine, both in the local certificate store and in all installed browsers, and can generate certificates from this CA.</p>
<p>To install <code>mkcert</code> with <code>brew</code>:</p>
<p><code>$ brew install mkcert</code></p>
<p>Before installing the <code>mkcert</code> CA and generating a certificate:</p>
<script src=https://gist.github.com/andmos/7fae6b63942f0c27f65cd1fd5dc9e47d.js></script>
<p>Please note, this CA and certificates generated from it is for <em>local</em> purposes only.</p>
<p>Next up, let&rsquo;s configure <code>nginx</code> to work as a reverse-proxy with SSL termination:</p>
<script src=https://gist.github.com/andmos/76fed99e90c2370eab3abcfd316d604e.js></script>
<p>This configuration will tell <code>nginx</code> to listen on <code>localhost</code>, port <code>5000</code> with the generated certificate from <code>mkcert</code>. Requests to <code>/</code> is then forwarded to the app, listening on plain old HTTP on port <code>80</code>.</p>
<p>The whole thing is then tied together with <code>docker-compose</code>:</p>
<script src=https://gist.github.com/andmos/b09aeb7bdef0e0d991140e199f41ea6f.js></script>
<p>Now run the whole thing with</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell>$ docker-compose up
</code></pre></div><p>Navigating to <code>https://localhost:5000/</code> reveals a nice HTTPS symbol:</p>

<h2 id=note>Note</h2>
<p>Unless <code>nginx</code> is used as reverse-proxy in the live environment, this solution will not be <em>excactly</em> on parity with staging or production, but the mechanisms and practices should be similar. As a rule of thumb, the Twelve-Factor app <a href=https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity>talks about the importance of dev/prod parity</a>.</p>
