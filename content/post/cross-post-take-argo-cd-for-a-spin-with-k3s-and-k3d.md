For the second year in a row, my current employer [Bekk](https://www.bekk.no/) has set out on a ambitious December journey:

[Bekk Christmas](https://bekk.christmas/), 264 tech articles in 24 days, each day of the advent calendar.

One of the categories was _thecloud.christmas_, so it felt natural to me to contribute here.

So here it it, from the 13th of December, my post about Kubernetes, ArgoCD, K3s and k3d. Enjoy [Take Argo CD for a spin with K3s
and k3d](https://www.bekk.christmas/post/2020/13/take-argo-cd-for-a-spin-with-k3s-and-k3d)!
