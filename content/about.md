Personal blog of Andreas Mosti. Mostly thoughts, ideas and crazy hacks from my life as a developer and operations guy.

I'm currently working as software developer (manager) at Bekk Consulting, previously Blueye Robotics and DIPS AS.

I like shiny things that automate infrastructure. Passionate about release engineering.
