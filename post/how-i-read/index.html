<h1>How I Read</h1>
</header>
<section class=post-content><p>During my last year of University College, I rediscovered my childhood joy of reading. At the time I was working on my bachelor’s degree (an app for the <a href=www.dips.no>company I now work for</a>) in a structured way from morning to afternoon, so my evenings were open for the first time in years. At one point, I had watched all seasons of The Wire, all seasons of House MD and Breaking Bad had come to its conclusion. Out of pure boredom, I decided, &ldquo;hey, might as well do some research on that bachelor thesis.&rdquo; So I went on Amazon and ordered Donald Norman&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Design-Everyday-Things-Expanded/dp/0465050654/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1426446749&sr=1-1">The Design of Everyday Things</a>.
When I got it the book I read it from cover to cover in 4 days. It was THAT good. I ordered Norman&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Living-Complexity-Donald-A-Norman/dp/0262014866/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1426447113&sr=1-1">Living with Complexity</a> next, before Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1426448269&sr=1-1&keywords=clean+code">Clean Code</a>.</p>
<p>The list goes on, and now after 15 months, I have read about 60 books, both fictional and non-fictional. How do I get through so many books? A lot has to do with organization.
###Tips and tricks for reading lots of books
A while ago I read an excellent <a href=http://lifehacker.com/my-secret-to-reading-a-lot-of-books-514189426>article</a> on <a href=http://lifehacker.com>Lifehacker</a> where a guy used <a href=https://trello.com>Trello</a> (a free service for organizing Kanban-boards) to keep track of his reading lists. I tried it out and found it really useful. In my board I have 4 categories: &lsquo;Backlog&rsquo;, &lsquo;To Read&rsquo;, &lsquo;Reading&rsquo; and &lsquo;Done&rsquo;. If I stumble upon a book I want to read, I put it in the Backlog. If the &lsquo;To Read&rsquo; list has less than 7 books in it or I want to read it in the near future, I put it in that category. Each book is also color coded, with blue for fiction and green for non-fiction and novels. As a rule of thumb, I try to read at least one non-fictional book each month to keep my brain up to speed and actually learn something.</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/ycM2jrX.png alt></p>
<p>The Kanban board also helps with motivation: Nothing is as good as dragging a book from &lsquo;Reading&rsquo; to &lsquo;Done&rsquo;.</p>
<p>To remember as much as possible I always keep a notebook handy when reading non-fiction. Before each reading session, I read the notes I wrote last time I sat down with the book to refresh. This technique has done wonders for my memory. Thanks to this habit, a notebook is now always with me, and it have saves more than one idea from oblivion. For reading academia and non-fiction, I try to set aside 30 minutes each day. A great place to get some reading done is in airports and on planes. Let’s face it, you just sit there and wait to get to where you are going anyway.</p>
<p>For reading two books simultaneously, audiobooks has revolutionized my life. If I want to read fiction (I find it too hard to concentrate while listening to non-fiction), I always check <a href=http://www.audible.com/>Audible</a> first.</p>
<p>By just listening to a audiobook to and from work, I get 40 minutes of book each day. Out for a jog? 30 minutes. Doing laundry? 15 minutes. All this time adds up, so going through a couple of books a month is easy. It is also easier for my brain to distinguishing between two books when one is read on paper and the other is listened to.</p>
<p>For e-books I use my Kindle and the Kindle-app is installed everywear. I use the excelente application <a href=http://calibre-ebook.com/>Calibre</a> to mange it all. This library is stored on my Dropbox.</p>
